No personal information, usage data or any other information is collected â€” nothing.

I use iCloud for syncing, with all synced data securely stored in your iCloud account.

## Third-party services
This policy does use Google Admob for advertising unless you've purchased the "Remove Ads" in-app purchase. Consult their third-party services.
