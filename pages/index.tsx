        <p>
          I am a full-stack developer working both as a freelancer, and employed
          at Novicell doing frontend work. I have a passion for learning and
          building awesome digital services/stuff that i want. I love launching
          new products, from the planning and designing to solving real-life
          problems with well coded solutions. I have launched several app
          projects to both Google Play and Apple Appstore. When not coding i
          enjoy tasting whisky, going on hikes, and reading sci-fi books.
